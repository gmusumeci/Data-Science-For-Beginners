# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education |I suppose each student is graded for his scool job every day | I collect student grade data for each day for each subject|Database | for each student, for each subject i plot average grade for month. I plot the average grade of all subjects for month too. At each moment I can see the trend of each student|
| Vaccination |I hypothesize that vaccinations at my center are administered based on the municipality of residence, and that I am responsible for a certain number of municipalities.|I collect list of residents in my municipalities and I produce a list of vaccinated people  |Database |I link residents with vaccinated people: I can know who is vaccined, who not and municipalities with problems.|
| Productivity |I suppose to have a list of task to do for each week. I can plan a number of task for each day according to the difficulty | Spreadsheet |At the end of the day if I have completed all my task I can fill a cell with a 'ok' string | |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
